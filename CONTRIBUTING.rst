If you find bugs, have suggestions or any other problems, feel free to
report an issue on the issue tracker or hit me up on IRC, I'm always
on ``#emacs``.  Patches are welcome, too, just fork, work on a
separate branch and open a pull request with it.

In case your bug is specific to a ROM, please send it to me via email
or upload it on an OCH and share the link with me.  Don't forget
attaching a debug log as produced by customizing ``chip8-debug``
before running the ROM, with the output being saved to a ``*CHIP-8
debug*`` buffer.
